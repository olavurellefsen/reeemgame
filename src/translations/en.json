      "intro": "Ever wondered how to balance economic, social and environmental interests?\n\nIn this game, you can explore how preferences on the three dimensions of sustainability - economy, socitey, and environment - affect what future power system design is perceived as optimal.\n\nFor a start you get assigned a Point Of View (POV) that indicates you how to weigh the three dimensions of sustainbility when making decisions on the future European power system design throughout the game.\n\nThe goal is to maximise your score in the year 2050. The score is based on the three indicators that you see on the right hand side of the window and which each relate to one of the three dimensions of sustainability. You can click on the indicators to illustrate them in the map. In the map you can select indivdual countries to explore their performance over time.\n\nOne can quickly play multiple rounds of the game. At the end of each round you can access the 'Sore'-board and see how your POV, decisions, and score compare across rounds.\n\nThe indicators and score are calculated based a large number of scenarios from the Open Source energy Model Base for Europe (OSeMBE), an open-source energy system optimisation model. You can read more about this game in the 'About' section, including the link to the documentation of OSeMBE."
